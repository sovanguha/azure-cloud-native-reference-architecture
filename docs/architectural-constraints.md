The solution design should consider the following constraints:
• Cost:
	• How much funding is available for solution implementation?
	• What is the expected ROI?
• Quality:
	• How closely should outcomes match FRs and NFRs?
	• How can we ensure and track the quality of the solution?
• Time:
	• When should the output be delivered?
	• Is there any flexibility regarding delivery time?
• Scope:
	• What are the exact expectations from business and customer requirements?
	• How does the requirement gap need to be handled and accommodated?
• Technology:
	• What technology can be utilized?
	• What flexibility does using legacy versus new technologies provide?
	• Should we build in-house or source from a vendor?
• Risk:
	• What can go wrong and how can we mitigate it?
	• What is the risk tolerance of stakeholders?
• Resource:
	• What is required to complete solution delivery?
	• Who will work on the solution’s implementation?
• Compliance:
	• What are the local legal requirements that might impact the solution?
	• What are the audit and certification requirements?
