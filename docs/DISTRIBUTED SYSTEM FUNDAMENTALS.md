Modern systems are distributed by default.

## Key concepts:
   - Horizontal scaling is preferred over vertical scaling
   - Failures are expected, not exceptional
   - Networks are unreliable
   - Latency matters

## Important trade-offs:
   - Strong consistency vs availability
   - Latency vs correctness
   - Operational simplicity vs control
   - Use eventual consistency when:
   - High availability is required
   - Temporary inconsistency is acceptable
