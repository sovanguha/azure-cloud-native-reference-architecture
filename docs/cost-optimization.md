Cost is a design constraint, not an afterthought.

## Key principles:
   - Autoscale instead of over-provisioning
   - Prefer managed services where possible
   - Monitor cost alongside performance
   - Avoid premature optimization

## Trade-offs:
   - Higher availability often increases cost
   - Faster performance may require premium services
