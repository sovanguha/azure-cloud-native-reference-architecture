MVP is a development strategy used to build a new product or website with the minimum amount of features necessary to satisfy 
early adopters and validate a product idea early in the product develop ment cycle. 

In this approach, the initial version of the product includes only the core features that allow the product to be deployed and no more. 
The goal is to provide immediate value, minimize development costs, and gather feedback from customers as quickly as possible to iterate
and improve the product over time.

One popular method of prioritizing customer requirements is MoSCoW, where you divide require ments into the following categories:
• Mo (must have): Requirements that are critical for your customers, without which the product cannot launch
• S (should have): Requirements that are the most desirable to the customer once they start utilizing the application
• Co (could have): Requirements that are nice to have, but their absence will not impact the desired functionality of the application
• W (won’t have): Requirements that customers may not notice if they are not there
