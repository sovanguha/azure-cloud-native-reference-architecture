Every system design problem is approached in a structured manner:

Step 1: Clarify Requirements

Functional requirements (what the system must do)

Non-functional requirements:

Scale

Latency

Availability

Security

Cost

Compliance

Step 2: Identify Constraints

Budget limits

Time-to-market

Team skill set

Regulatory requirements

Step 3: High-Level Architecture

Define major components

Define data flow

Define communication patterns (sync vs async)

Step 4: Deep Dive on Critical Areas

Scalability bottlenecks

Failure handling

Data consistency

Security boundaries

Step 5: Trade-offs & Risks

What is optimized?

What is intentionally not optimized?

What may need rework in the future?
