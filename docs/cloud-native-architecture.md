In cloud-native architecture, you continually create automated operations for recovery, scalability, self-healing, and high availability 
using the cloud capabilities of continuous integration (CI), deployment, and infrastructure automation. It encourages the continuous 
optimization of your application n terms of cost and performance, using new cloud capabilities that are released and improved upon every day.

Cloud-native doesn’t mean hosting your application on the cloud platform.
This may include the following:
• Containerizing your monolithic architecture in a microservice and creating a CI/CD pipeline for automated deployment.
• Building a serverless application with technology such as AWS Lambda FaaS and Amazon DynamoDB (a managed NoSQL database in the cloud).
• Creating a serverless data lake, by using Amazon S3 (a managed object storage service), AWS Glue (a managed Spark cluster for ETL), 
  and Amazon Athena (a managed Presto cluster for ad hoc queries) for example.
• Using a cloud-native monitoring and logging service, for example, Amazon CloudWatch.
• Using a cloud-native auditing service, for example, AWS CloudTrail.

Crucial factors such as high availability, disaster recovery, and scalability are taken care of by thesecloud-native services 
so that you can focus on your feature development.

The benefit of cloud-native architecture is that it enables fast-paced innovation and agility in the team.
