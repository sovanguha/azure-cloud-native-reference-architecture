Security is designed in, not added later.

## Core principles:

    - Never trust implicitly
    - Always authenticate and authorize
    - Least-privilege access
    - Defense in depth

## Key practices:
    - Azure AD (Entra ID) for identity
    - Managed Identity for services
    - RBAC for authorization
    - Key Vault for secrets
    - Private endpoints for sensitive services
