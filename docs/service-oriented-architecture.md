In SOA patterns, different application components interact using a communication protocol over the network. Each service provides
end-to-end functionality. SOA is widely adopted by large systems to integrate business processes.

SOAs take monolithic applications and spread some of those operations into individual services that operate independently.The goal of using
an SOA is to loosen the coupling of your application’s services.
