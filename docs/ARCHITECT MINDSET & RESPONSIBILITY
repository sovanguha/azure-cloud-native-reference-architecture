A solution architect is responsible for decisions, not diagrams.

## Key responsibilities:

 - Translate business goals into technical systems
 - Balance scalability, security, reliability, and cost
 - Own architectural trade-offs and long-term consequences
 - Design systems that can evolve, not just work today

## Core principle:

   Every architectural decision introduces a trade-off. The role of the architect is to make those trade-offs explicit and intentional.
