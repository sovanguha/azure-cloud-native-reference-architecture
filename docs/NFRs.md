In relation to NFRs, solutions architects ask themselves the following questions:
## Performance:
	• What will the application load time be for users?
	• How can we handle network latency?
## Security and compliance:
	• How can we secure an application from unauthorized access?
	• How can we protect an application from malicious attacks?
	• How do we adhere to local laws and audit requirements?
## Recoverability:
	• How can we recover an application from an outage?
	• How can we minimize recovery time in the event of an outage?
	• How can we recover lost data?
## Maintainability:
	• How can we ensure application monitoring and alerts?
	• How can we ensure application support?
## Reliability:
	• How can we make sure the application performs consistently?
	• How do we inspect and correct glitches?
## Availability:
	• How can we ensure the high availability of an application?
	• How can we make an application fault-tolerant?
## Scalability:
	• How can we meet the increasing demand for resources?
	• How can we accommodate scaling for a sudden spike in utilization?
## Usability:
	• How can we simplify an application’s use?
	• How can we achieve a seamless user experience?
	• How can we make the application accessible to a diverse set of users?
